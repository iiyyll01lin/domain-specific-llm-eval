Cybersecurity Best Practices
        
        Cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
        
        Essential security measures:
        - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
        - Regular software updates and patches
        - Strong password policies
        - Network segmentation
        - Employee security training
        - Backup and recovery procedures
        - Incident response planning
        
        Common threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
