Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
        Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the ability of machines to receive data and learn for themselves without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Key components of machine learning include:
        - Supervised learning: Learning with labeled training data
        - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in data without labels  
        - Reinforcement learning: Learning through rewards and punishments
        - Neural networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
        
        Applications of AI and ML include natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.
